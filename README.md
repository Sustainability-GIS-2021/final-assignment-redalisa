### Status

Once you are finished with the final assignment, edit this readme and add "x" to the correct box:

* [ ] Submitted

* [x] I'm still working on my final assignment. 


## Instructions

Read the final assignment instructions from the course webpages [https://sustainability-gis.readthedocs.io](https://sustainability-gis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/final-assignment/final-assignment.html). Remember to write readable code, and to provide adequate documentation using inline comments and markdown. Organize all your documents into this repository and add your codes and written parts to the [final_assignment.ipynb](final_assignment.ipynb) Notebook. In sum, anyone who downloads this repository should be able to **read your code and documentation** and understand what is going on, and **run your code** in order to reproduce the same results! 

**Note 1:** If your code requires some python packages not found in the csc notebooks environment, please mention them also in this readme and provide installation instrutions.

**Note 2:** Don't upload large files into GitHub! If you are using large input files, provide downloading instructions and perhaps a small sample of the data in this repository for demonstrating your workflow.

**Note 3:** Cite relevant literature related to the topic, and also add links to websites, tutorials books or articles that you found useful. If you got help from your course mates please also mention it in your report.
